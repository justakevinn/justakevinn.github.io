To put in new reactions:

Create a new folder, and name it the next available integeer in the "Reactions" folder.

Use Chemdraw to draw out the starting material, product, and each of the intermediates and individually save them as png files
    Names of files should be sm.png, product.png, int0.png, int1.png, and int2.png

Draw out the conditions and fit them into the reagents box (adjust your font size and do NOT resize the box!)
Save the reagents in the "Reagents" folder and name them with the following syntax: rxnx_y; where x is the reaction number and y is the index of the reagents

Things to do (consider doing):

    Generate a seed based on the current time so that the answer cannot be simply deduced by refreshing a page multiple times
    Remove hovering text that gives hints to the solution 
    Label the product and starting material - maybe also add a retrosynthetic arrow
    Scaling all objects based on browser window size (might make the game mobile compatible?)
    Reveal Answer when game over
