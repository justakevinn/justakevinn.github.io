How to put in new reactions:

Create a new folder
    Name folder the next available integer

In chemdraw, draw out each of the intermediates and save them as png files (export as -> png) in the folder
    int0, int1, int2, int3
Name the intermediates in the order in which they will appear in the game (intermediate closest to the product is int0)

Draw out reagents, keep them in the reagents box
    save reagents in the reagents folder and name them rxnx_y; where x is the reaction number and y is the index of the reagents


Known problems:

by hovering on top of the box after inputting a reagent, you can see the "id" of the reagent - which can be used to deduce the order
